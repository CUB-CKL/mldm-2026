`}`

### Course

- fundamentals of statistics;
- linear and kernel models;
- decision trees and ensembles;
- recommendation systems;
- deep learning.

### Home Assignments

2 home assignments ("homeworks"):
- each consist of a number of exercises;
- 2 weeks for submitting homework;
  - each additional week: 0.25 points penalty;
- final score for an assignment:
  $$\max \left[ 1, \sum_i \mathrm{exercise}_i \right] - \mathrm{penalty}$$

~~~center
\textbf{
  Home assignments must be your own work. \\
  Tools allowed for use will be specified in homework descriptions.
}
~~~

### Exam

`\vspace*{5mm}`

Exam:
- a presentation on Machine Learning challenge you took part in:
  - a non-trivial solution;
  - elaborate on method/features/... you chose.
- overview of an advanced Machine Learning paper:
  - some suggestions will be on lectures (under Further Reading etc);
  - a list of preapproved advanced papers will be provided.

~~~center
\textbf{ \large Please, discuss your choice with me beforehand,\\ send me paper/draft of your presentation in advance.}
~~~

### Final grades

$$\text{Final grade} = 50\% \cdot \text{homeworks} + 50\% \cdot \text{exam}$$

$$\text{Final grade} = \left\lceil \frac{5}{2} \cdot \text{homework score} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{exam score} \right\rceil$$
where:
- homework score - sum of all marks for the homeworks (max 1 per each, max 2 in total);
- exam score - mark on the exam, max 10.
